# What I've Learned:

* PHP basics. This project was really started out of the goal to learn how to write backend. With that goal in mind I believe I have succeed in that sense. Although there are some major reworks I would like to do eventually, I am happy with what I know now.
* Backend Client vs. Server on the web. Although I have worked with client and server applications when game scripting, there are obviously major differences with websites and their functionality. Taking the time to learn PHP for serverside and javascript for clientside was a fun adventure. 
* Secruity. Websites are highly prone to users attempting to gain the system and access informaton that they shouldn't have. As such, I've taken the time to make my SQL databases have hashed passwords with salt. Also I have taken in mind basic principles such as "don't trust the user" and sanitizing input. The book I read while doing this project gave a lot of great insight and tools.
* SQL. Not really much to say here, other than it was really cool using databases and I think they are a really great concept. I wish I took the time to write better PHP code to handle them. 
* Typescript. Javascript, in my opinion, is a really bloated and confusing language. Nothing is consistent and it feels like it makes up rules on the spot. To compound this, they do not have abstract classes or interfaces, which I wanted to use as while building the widget system. So I switched over to Typescript. I like typescript a lot and it works really well with JSX to become TSX.
* React. In the beginning, I attempted to apply my own rules to React. This was a terrible idea and costed me hours of my time as it all came crashing down as it caused major issues. I had to scrap everything I worked on and rebuild the system.

* Stackoverflow and other random blogs.
